# Hi i'm Nav
Hi i'm Nav as you can see by title, who am I well I like to code and make random shit with coding. The primary languages that I use are Javascript (Superior to python using python = beta move), HTML and css. I mainly focus on stuff that is in the backend since I am not really the best at the front end, so like if your gonna recruit me to do something, you know what not to recruit me for. You can clearly see how bad I am at the front end on one of my [repositories](https://github.com/BDWNAV/socket.io-chat-project)
